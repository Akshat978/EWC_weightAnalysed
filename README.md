# EWC_weightAnalysed
Initialized 7 different kaiming and xavier initializations for the first 2 tasks of the cifar10 dataset.
Weights of each layer are updated and initialized with these inits and then plotted and you can see how each initialization varies the weight pixels and changes the graphs plotted
